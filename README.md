# ðŸ§® Grade Tagger in Python

This is a fun beginner-level Python project where I built a **grade and tag calculator** for 12th-grade students. It asks for your name and marks in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and English â€” and then returns:
- Your percentage
- Your grade (A, B, C, or F)
- A personalized performance tag like `"TopPerformer"` or `"Underperformer"`

### ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This
As a complete beginner in Python, I wanted to kick off my journey with something simple, interactive, and fun. This is my **first-ever project**, and it's just the beginning of many more to come.

### ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Input/Output
- Functions
- Conditional statements
