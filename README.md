# ðŸ§® Grade Tagger in Python

This is a fun beginner-level Python project where I built a **grade and tag calculator** for 12th-grade students. It asks for your name and marks in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and English â€” and then returns:
- Your percentage
- Your grade (A, B, C, or F)
- A personalized performance tag like `"TopPerformer"` or `"Underperformer"`
